Have done:
1.The React front end to show the all employees page.
2.Create new employees function.
3.Update employee function.
4.Delete employee function.
5.Used bootstrap to implement the mobile responsive.

Some improvement still working on:
1. Inner join the Employee Table and Role table to show the employee's role name.
2.When update and add the employee add the role drop down function into the page.
3.Add page index and page size function.
4.Using ado.net or entity framework to using SQL instead of LINQ(I used the one LINQ in the app and plan to instead of it.)
